## Abstract

The `CSS Space` module defines a three-dimensional layout system, optimized for user interface design. In the space layout model, the children of a space container can be positioned at a predefined spatial location.



## Status Of This Document

This document is NOT part of the current CSS standards and is merely a proposal, as implemented in the [`plurid`](https://github.com/plurid/plurid) framework.

The document is being written keeping an eye open on the formalization, practices, and discourse of [CSS Grid Layout Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/) and [CSS Flexible Box Layout Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/).



## 1. Introduction

<i>This section is not normative.</i>

Space Layout is a layout model for CSS that grants the abilities to control the sizing and positioning of 2-dimensional planes and their contents within a 3-dimensional structure. Unlike [Grid Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/), which is optimized for 2-dimensional layouts, and [Flexible Box Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/), which is single-axisâ€“oriented, Space Layout is optimized for 3-dimensional layouts: those in which alignment of content is desired in three dimensions.

Space Layout is not meant as a replacement of Grid or Flexible Box Layout, but is the logical extension into the third dimension of the layout interface. The 2-dimensional planes in fact should rely on Grid and Flexible Box Layout, as well as all the other standard CSS rules, to obtain the desired design.


** exemplary figures **



    // Example 1

    // CSS
    #space {
        display: space;
        /*
            vp - viewport units
        */
        space-template-columns: 1vp 0.3vp
        // space-template-rows: ???

        /*
            to use 'sheaf' <-> 'sheaves' as the 3-dimensional equivalent to rows and columns?
        */
        space-template-sheaves: ???
    }

    // HTML
    <div id="space">
        <div id="page-1"></div>
        <div id="page-2"></div>
        <div id="page-3"></div>
    </div>



## Notes

### Quantization


To "break" the space into "quanta".

    :root {
        space-quantize: pre;
        space-quantize: post;
    }


### Modifiiers

    :root {
        space-modifier-rotation: shift;
        space-modifier-translation: alt | option;
        space-modifier-scale: control | ctrl | command | cmd;
    }
